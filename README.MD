Ensure that SLAM.py is located in the same folder as the Cython files. Furthermore,
ensure that there is a folder 'data' in the same folder as the SLAM.py file, which 
contains the encoder and lidar readings for maps 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24.

Then, execute using
python SLAM.py

The files which display the maps will be saved in the same directory
